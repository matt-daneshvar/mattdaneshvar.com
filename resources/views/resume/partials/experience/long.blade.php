    <p>
        I started working at
        <a href="https://4thirteen.com.my" target="_blank">4 Thirteen</a>
        as a part-time developer just before my undergraduate studies began.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ambitious with a touch of naivety, I built every single piece of work from scratch
        <em>(I thought why use 3rd party packages when I can build it myself)</em>,
        built my very own backend framework
        <em>(just like every other PHP developer has done at some point)</em>,
        refused to use an IDE
        <em>(because I wanted to type everything and get good at it)</em>,
        and told my CEO that we can build another Facebook
        <em>(..and we kind of did that)</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        My interest was always beyond being a 9-5 employee; together with the team we fixed mistakes in our
        accounting department, built a new rate card, moved all our clients to cloud, and started shipping our very
        first internal products.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of those products was
        <a href="https://scismic.com" target="_blank">Scismic</a>
        - A social media platform for people in life
        sciences that we built while partnering with 3 Harvard graduates.
        This particular project earned us a special status given by the Malaysian government that’d make it a lot
        easier for us to hire foreign staff and exempt us from paying taxes for our tech services for the next 5 years.

    'title' => 'Head of Technology',
    'organization' => '4 Thirteen Group'
])
    <p>
        After about 2 years at 4 Thirteen, I became the Head of the Technology department, the department that
        we eventually turned into a business division in 2017 and branded as
        <a href="https://code413.io" target="_blank">Code413</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through a good dose of mistakes and many occasions of embarrassing myself, I started to learn to think
        beyond a programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Together with this small team at Code413,
        we’ve delivered 10s of web projects, created 10s of MVPs, and launched a few of our own products.
    </p>
    <p>
        My average day is 60% working on our internal products
        <em>(many of which are led by other members of the team)</em>,
        20% assisting with the projects we do for our clients,
        15% business development,
        and the rest, walking to and back from the pantry with my cup of tea.

    'period' => '2019 - Current',
    'title' => 'Founder',
    'organization' => 'Race.my'
])
    <p>
        Out of my frustration with the online experience every time I registered for a race,
        I started creating a new registration platform as my side project; Once an MVP was ready, we brought the
        project under the 4 Thirteen umbrella, we called it
        <a href="https://race.my" target="_blank">Race.my</a>,
        and accelerated it with more resources as our new venture.
    </p>
    <p>
        My role at Race.my involves a combination of business development, customer support,
        and a decent amount of coding.

    'title' => 'Freelance Web Developer',
])
    <p>
        Ever since I learnt a little bit about writing code for web, I started picking up freelance projects
        to expose myself to more domains and to boost my finances.
        I've built and maintained websites, e-commerce stores, and web apps covering a few different domains
        including f&b, education, and Fintech.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from working office hours 4 days a week at 4 Thirteen, I get some extra time in my weekdays
        and weekends that I spend to do my side projects and freelance jobs. I’m always in lookout for remote jobs
        that require 20 hours or less per week.
